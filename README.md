# Adelia -  elite simple imageboard


Based on Claire, tinyib, and vichan 

There are lots of imageboard scripts on github, most of them are horrible! Adelia is a no-nonsense modular solution. 

made for the most modern versions of php only

video and file uploads

put /js and /stylesheets (from vichan) in the root, then each directory like /a /b contains adelia code. As such, this can use any of the vichan js scripts or css, which is quite incredible. Its like having vichan with less than 1/100th of the vichan codebase ! 

just run it- sets up sqlite2 db and needed directories !!

This uses static html files- so visitors land on html pages only so its super fast loading for visitors. 

Last but not least, this code is incredibly easy to feed to Ai in order to audit or change anything you want!
