Based on Claire, tinyib, and vichan 

There are lots of imageboard scripts on github, most of them are horrible! Adelia is a no-nonsense modular solution. 

made for the most modern versions of php only

put /js and /stylesheets (from vichan) in the root, then each directory like /a /b contains adelia code. As such, this can use any of the vichan js scripts or css, which is quite incredible. Its like having vichan with less than 1/100th of the vichan codebase !
