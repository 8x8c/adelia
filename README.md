Based on Claire, tinyib, and vichan 


v1-  Put all of vichan /js and /stylesheets into a root directory. then rename the dir adelia-v1 to anything, and put that directory in the root. Then simply run post.php and it automatically sets itself up - makes the directories and sqlite3 db for you. BAM. You can think of this as sort of a 1 file vichan. Quite remarkable! Note--- not done yet needs a bit of work
